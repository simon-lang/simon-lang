    //- p I specialise as Front End Javascript Developer - specifically ES6, Angular & React. I'd love to use TypeScript and Vue.js in my next major project.
    //- p I'm also competent fullstack with Node. Previous experience (not recent) with PHP, .NET and Java. Basic familiarity with some other stacks, but not extensive experience.
    //- p I am not a sysadmin or devops. My linux command line skills are fine, but I've always worked with sysadmins.
    //- p I'm also not a designer. My CSS knowledge is fairly strong, but I love working with really talented web designers and letting them handle the look and feel.
    //- p No experience with native app development, sorry. Web only.
