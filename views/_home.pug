    <p class="lead">I'm an Aussie web developer based in Brisbane. I have a Software Engineering degree, and more importantly, about 15 years of <a href="#/employment">industry experience</a>.</p>
    <p>I specialise in modern Javascript & NodeJS development, but also have experience with a <a href="#/skills">wide range of web technologies</a>, and always love to learn new ones. </p>
    <p>My main stack in recent years is ES6 & Angular, but I'd love to use TypeScript and Vue.js in my next major project.</p>
    <p>If you think I'd be suitable for a project of yours, please get in touch (contact details at the bottom of this document).</p>
