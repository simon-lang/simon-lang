    h1 When not working

    p I'm the lucky father of two year old identical twin girls. So as passionate as I am about web development, I'll always choose my family over working late. If you're looking for someone willing to put in 60 hour work weeks, I'm not the right choice.

    p If I ever get time to myself, you'll find me working in my garden.
